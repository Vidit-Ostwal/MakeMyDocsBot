analyze_branch_documentation_changes_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the specific documentation file at {file_path} in branch {branch_name} to identify all content changes and modifications. The tool requires the branch name and changed file path as input and will automatically:

    1. Connect to the GitHub repository 
    2. Analyze all changes in the branch
    3. Extract metadata about English documentation modifications
    4. Return structured data about changed files and sections

    Simply call your custom tool with {branch_name} and {file_path} and it will provide comprehensive analysis results showing exactly what documentation content has been modified, including file paths, section titles, line numbers, and the actual changed content. Analyze the outcome of the tool and then make the expected format result.
    Your response is essentail for next agents.
  expected_output: >
    A structured JSON object showing the analysis of the specific file at {file_path}, it will be a list of sections changed in this particular file {file_path}:
    ```json
    {
      "SECTIONS_CHANGED": [
        {
            "level": 1 / 2 / 3 / 4,
            "title": "The title / heading of the section changed",
            "context": "New context",
            "full_context_flag": True / False
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    The output should contain:
    - **SECTIONS_CHANGED**: Object with list of changed sections

    Each changed section should include:
    - **level**: The level of the changed (Title, Sub-Title, Heading/ Sub-Heading)
    - **title**: The section title/heading text
    - **context**: The actual modified context from that section
    - **full_context_flag**: Whether a part of the section is being changed or complete sections

    Provide comprehensive analysis of all modifications within the specified file.

validate_translation_file_structure_task:
  description: >
    Perform comprehensive index mapping and structural validation between the English source file and its Korean and Portuguese - Brazil translation counterparts. You will:

    1. **Analyze source file structure** from the English documentation changed file {file_path}
    2. **Map section indexes** between English and Korean, Portuguese-Brazil files using your custom index mapping tools
    3. **Validate structural consistency** including:
      - Section hierarchy levels (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
      - Section titles and their positioning
      - Overall document structure alignment
      - Index mapping accuracy between source and translation files
    4. **Identify structural discrepancies** such as:
      - Missing sections in Korean, Portuguese (Brazil) files
      - Mismatched section hierarchies
      - Incorrect index mappings
      - Inconsistent document organization
    5. **Auto-correct structure issues** using your read-write tools when discrepancies are found:
      - Add missing sections to Korean files and Portuguese (Brazil)
      - Adjust section hierarchies to match source
      - Fix index mapping inconsistencies
      - Ensure structural parity across languages

    Use your custom tools to perform detailed index mapping analysis and structural validation. If any structural issues are detected, automatically correct them to ensure the Korean files and Portuguese Brazil maintain perfect structural alignment with the English source files.

    Process the English documentation changes from the documentation_change_analyzer agent and generate structured Korean translation updates. You will:

    1. **Use your translation mapping tool** with the {file_path} and SECTIONS_CHANGED list one for each object in the list to get releavant sections indexing
    2. **Match sections** between English changes (from SECTIONS_CHANGED) and Korean files using section title and context
    3. **Generate Korean translations** of the changed English content
    4. **Produce structured output** with exact line ranges and replacement content
     
    Your translation mapping tool will provide the releavnt sections information with the existing context. Use this to identify which Korean sections correspond to the changed English sections.

    **Input Data Structure:**

    Process the Korean and Portuguese (Brazil) translation updates from the previous tasks and apply each content change using the File Content Updater Tool. You will:

    1. **Parse the Korean and Portuguese (Brazil) translation updates** received from the Korean Translator and Postuguese Brazil Translator Agents
    2. **Apply changes systematically** using the File Content Updater Tool for each section update. Call the tool every time you want to make a change on any particular file.
    3. **Validate each change** and provide detailed success/failure reporting
    4. **Commit changes to GitHub** using the GitHub commit tool with a descriptive commit message that includes:
    - Summary of translation updates applied
    - List of files modified
    - Specific sections that were translated
    - Reference to the source branch/file that triggered the updates

    **Input Format Expected:**
    ```json
    [
        {
          "FILE_PATH": FILE TO BE CHANGED_1,
          "CONTENT_TO_BE_DELETED_START_LINE": -1,

    **Processing Steps:**
    1. FileContentUpdaterTool Tool can make only one change at a time, you will need to call this multiple times to make all the changes,
    2. This is your feature branch {branch_name}
    3. This is the file path which you are going to change, understand the tool output, you will get this from there.
    4. After updating all the changes, you need to commit the changes as well, use the GitCommitTool for that.
